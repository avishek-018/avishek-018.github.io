## Superhero Name Generator
* Tech Stack: Python, Tensorflow, Flask, JS, CSS, HTML
* Github URL: [Project Link](https://github.com/avishek-018/Superhero-Name-Generator)
* Goals and Objectives of the project**

  The developed system is based on deep learning sequence generation. We created a character level language model that will predict the next character for a given input sequence. To get a new predicted superhero name, we'll need to give our model a seed input, which can be a single character or a sequence of characters, and the model will then produce the next character it thinks should come after the input sequence.This character is then added to the seed input to create a new input, which is then used again to generate the next character, and so on.

## TransEmoC-A Transformer-Based Unified Toolkit for Emotion Classification in a Low Resource Language


* Tech Stack: Python, Tensorflow, Keras
* Capsule URL: Link
* Github URL: Project Link

**Goals and Objectives of the project**
You can train/validate transformer models with this module. The datset has been attached for the ease of use. You can also predict emotion from textual expression with the trained model.

This git repo is a part of the Project Emotion Classification in a Resource Constrained Language. The proposed model described in the corresponding paper is wrapped up in this git project for reuse by developers and researchers.

## IOT Based Face Recognition Attendance System
* Tech Stack: Python, PyQT5, Tensorflow, OpenCV
* Github URL: Project Link

**Goals and Objectives of the project**

There can be two types of implementations:

* Student will be sitted to their seat on classroom & a HD camera can recognize all the students at once and give them attendance per class.
* Attendance will be given as students enter the door of the classroom so that we can track when one comes in and goes out(suitable to track student activities). As there are CC Cameras installed in our facility, we may implement on cc tv footage.
