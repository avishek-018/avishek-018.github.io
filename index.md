## About Me
<div style="text-align: justify">
Focused and enthusiastic <b>python</b> developer with a keen interest in <b>machine learning</b> and deep learning. <b>Natural Language Processing</b> is another branch of interest that has been a part of my expertise for a long time. By comprehensive exposure to the underlying concepts and applying them vividly to various projects, my love for these domains came into being. I consider myself as a passionate, punctual, and sincere individual who always tries to learn and undertake new challenges.
